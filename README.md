# Static Node.js and Express Site
![Screenshot of site](https://github.com/Stelkooo/static-nodejs-and-express-site/blob/main/public/images/screenshotOfSite.png)
This is a portfolio site to showcase the first 5 projects of my JavaScript Treehouse Tech Degree

It contains a landing page, about page, and each of the 5 projects has its own page

All the data regarding the projects such its name, descriptions, technologies used, and more is stored in a JSON file

Then Pug is used to create templates and use that JSON data to generate the markup for the site pages

Node.js and Express is used for this site to:
- Import dependencies
- Link the JSON with the Pug templates
- Set up routes to handle requests
- Set up middleware to use static files like CSS, JS, and images
- Handle errors
- Set up a server to show the project off

I changed a few things about the styling of the app from its standard look, they include:
- The background colour
- Font
- Font colour
- Borders
