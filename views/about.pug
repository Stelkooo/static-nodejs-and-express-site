        .about-bio

          p I am an aspiring web developer who loves to solve a coding puzzle. I recently quit my IT Support job as towards the end the only joy I really got out of the job is scripting automation tasks for our servers and myself. I feel the need to constantly learn new things and skills, and I am only got the this feeling when thinking of a new to improve our IT systems.
